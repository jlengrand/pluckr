Pluckr is a (currently non-functional) project aiming at helping folks find available trees, plants and spices to pluck from.

## About the project

This project is build with [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) for the backend, backed by a PostgreSQL database and using [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) to interact with the database.
The frontend is buildt with [Open-WC](https://open-wc.org/), [Lit](http://lit.dev/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) in Javascript.

## Running the project locally

The project is in 3 separate pieces. You need to : 

* Fire up a PostgreSQL database, I use a local Docker image for the moment
* Fire the backend. You do this using `./gradlew run`. 
  * By default, the app will run with a H2 in memory database. Change the config file to run another configuration 
  * ( ex: `$./gradlew run --args="-config=src/main/resources/application.test.conf`)
* Fire the frontend. It is located in `src/js/pluckr-app`. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`

## TODOs

* Adds tests and install [Kover](https://lengrand.fr/kover-code-coverage-plugin-for-kotlin/)
* Look into Qonada and Detekt
* Automated deployment
* Setup local and remote db
* Build the freaking project
* How to see trends with Detekt?
